# The Energy Market has a Data Science Problem {background-image="static/images/gradient2-A1aNg8Lg5NTlR0e3.svg"}

::: notes
> Hi! I'm Dave and I'm here to share my work on ENGI.AI.

-   The energy market has a data science problem.
:::

## Demand for skills \> Supply of people {background-image="static/images/gradient_1-AGBjrE8Wxpc68qqN.svg"}

::: {.columns style="display: flex !important; height: 90%;"}

:::

::: {.column style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"}

:::
:::

::: notes
-   Very difficult to hire data scientists, no offence to the JavaScript/PHP/Ruby devs, but we are pretty out-numbered
    -   Hard to find with correct skills
        -   Tend to have a minimum of an Undergraduate Degree in Engineering or Mathematics
        -   Important to have Energy Market domain knowledge AND general software development skills in addition to Data Science Experience
-   This is what is making it hard to scale data science in the energy market
    -   And therefore also the products that rely on them
:::


## Forecasting is the goal {background-image="static/images/gradient_1-AGBjrE8Wxpc68qqN.svg"}

::: {.columns style="display: flex !important; height: 90%;"}

:::
:::

::: notes
-   Forecasting is the most common data science objective
    -   according to 95% of data scientists in the energy market
-   The reasons for forecasting are quite common
    -   Trading
    -   Management
    -   Efficiency
    -   Storage
    -   Generation
-   All of these are reliant on, or can be enhanced by, good forecasting

## Data is fueling a Clean Tech Boom {background-image="static/images/gradient_1-AGBjrE8Wxpc68qqN.svg"}


> "The majority of buildings in the UK have a smart meter" - *BEIS*

- Energy management and reporting 
- Home Automation and IoT
- Electric Vehicle Charging
- Domestic Solar PV and Battery Storage

::: notes
-   As smart meter uptake increases, so does the amount of data available
    -   This information is being actively used to achieve Net-Zero by energy management and reporting companies
    -   Most of the products need some form of forecasting the expected energy demand so that it can be met in the greenest possible way
    -   This is also true for the people who run the grid.

## Network Operators to System Operators {background-image="static/images/gradient_1-AGBjrE8Wxpc68qqN.svg"}

::: {.columns style="display: flex !important; height: 90%;"}
::: {.column}
**DNO**

- Own, operate and maintain the distribution network
:::
::: {.column}
**DSO**

- Monitor, control and actively manage the power flows
- Enable Distributed Energy Resources on distribution networks
- Enable customers to be producers, consumers and storers of energy
:::
:::

::: notes
-   OFGEM is pushing for Distribution Network Operators to become Distribution System Operators
    -   Distribution Network Operators to become Distribution System Operators
    -   A DSO's responsibility expands on a DNO's
        -   As a DSO they need to become more actively involved in the operation of the network
        -   In order to control and actively manage the power flows, they are going to need an accurate forecast of the demand, at a more granular level than they have now
    -   This is need is also shared by virtual power plant operators
        -   Who need to be able to forecast the demand of their aggregated assets
