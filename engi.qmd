# The energy market has a data science problem


## Everyone needs forecasts

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.r-fit-text}
> "Forecasting using Time Series is the most common technique used in Data Science departments for companies in the Energy Market" - **Energy Systems Catapult Report**
:::
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](3308891-200.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}
:::
:::

::: notes
-   Forecasting is the most common data science objective
    -   according to 95% of data scientists in the industry
-   Forecasting future energy demand, and the associated cost or supplying it.
:::

## Data access is not the challenge

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
> "The majority of buildings in the UK have a smart meter" - **BEIS/ONS?**
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](3308891-200.png){.r-stretch}
:::
:::

::: notes
-   Over 50% of the buildings in the UK have smart meters
    -   According to BEIS
-   Octopus customers have first class integrations to their smart meter
-   Industry standard data aggregators and D10 flow

## Rebuilding expensive wheels is the problem

> 40% of companies find it "Very Difficult" to hire Data Scientists with the right skills - **Energy Systems Catapult Report**

\begin{gather*}
cost = (salary * members) + compute + dev time\\
cost = (50000 * [5-9]) + ? + ?
\end{gather*}

::: notes
-   Very difficult to hire data scientists
    -   Expensive to hire
        -   Base salary of 50,000 per head
            -   https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Salaries/uk-data-scientist-salary-SRCH_IL.0,2_IN2_KO3,17.htm?clickSource=searchBtn
    -   Hard to find with correct skills
        -   Tend to have a minimum of an Undergraduate Degree in Engineering or Mathematics
        -   Important to have Energy Market domain skills AND general software development skills in addition to Data Science Experience

# Existing non-solutions

## EPC/SAP

![](/example-epc.png)

-   Complex 

::: notes
-   Government mandated Excel Calculator
-   Requires survey or desktop study
-   Only gives a usage range over year
:::


## Building simulation

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](/autodesk.svg){width="100%"}
![](/Energyplus.gif){width="70%"}
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
-  requires specialists to both survey and then operate
   -  hard to build
-  requires a different model and survey per building
   -  can't scale at all
:::
:::

::: notes
-   EnergyPlus and AutoDesk
-   Whole building physics simulation
-   Highly specialised and technical
-   Not scaleable as each building needs it's own model
-   Difficult/illegal to integrate into other software
-   Intended primarily for architecture/engineering work
:::

## In-House Excel

::: notes
-   Painful to build, worse to maintain
-   Time to calculate a sheet can be over 45 minutes for advanced models
-   Doesn't scale without more hiring to 'drive' the sheets
:::

## In-House Software Development

::: notes
-   Re-invent a common wheel internally is expensive, complicated + time consuming
:::

# The ENGI.AI solution

::: notes
-   Energy forecasting as a service
    -   Plug and play into your existing software
-   Best practice techniques
-   AI doesn't need a description of the building
    -   So no surveys
-   Designed to be integrated
-   Developer friendly
:::
