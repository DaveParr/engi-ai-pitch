# The energy market has a data science problem

## Forecasting is the goal

- Forecasting is the most common data science objective in the energy market
- Forecasting is the process of taking prior information and using it to make predictions about the future before it happens
  - according to 95% of data scientists in the industry

## Enables

- Sophisticated demand side response to help support load balancing.
  - Solves peak power carbon intensity
- Smart storage control algorithms to improve utilisation of renewable energy.
  - Solves virtual power plants
- Smart meters to reduce costs through dynamic prices or improve energy efficiency.
  - Big Turn down
- Electric vehicles enabled with two-way communications to provide distributed control and reduce network strain.
  - Third Industrial Revolution power supply

## Data access is not the challenge

- Over 50% of the buildings in the UK have smart meters
  - According to BEIS
- Octopus customers have first class integrations to their smart meter
- Industry standard data aggregators and D10 flow

## Hiring is

- Very difficult to hire data scientists
  - Expensive to hire
    - Base salary of 50,000 per head
  - Hard to find with correct skills

# Existing non-solutions

## EPC/SAP

- Government mandated Excel Calculator
- Requires survey or desktop study
- Only gives a usage range oer year

## Building design simulation

- EnergyPlus and AutoDesk
- Whole building physics simulation
- Highly specialised and technical
- Not scaleable as each building needs it's own model
- Difficult/illegal to integrate into other software
- Intended primarily for architecture/engineering work

## In-House Excel

- Painful to build, worse to maintain
- Time to calculate a sheet can be over 45 minutes for advanced models
- Doesn't scale without more hiring to 'drive' the sheets

## Custom service

- Re-invent a wheel internally is expensive, complicated + time consuming
- Need a team of Data Scientists
  - If you've found people with the right skills, they probably came from a place that's already done this
  - If you haven't found people with the right skills, they have a huge amount to learn
- So you either reinvent a solution, or take years to upskill enough to find it

# The ENGI.AI solution

- Best practice techniques
- AI doesn't need a description of the building
  - So no surveys
- Integrable and developer friendly

# Who am I
- 10 years building analytics software and data science services
- 8 years in energy efficiency and management market
- 2 years leading software and product development
