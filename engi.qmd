# The Energy Market has a Data Science Problem {background-image="static/images/gradient2-A1aNg8Lg5NTlR0e3.svg"}

> Hi! I'm Dave and I'm here to share my work on ENGI.AI.

-   The energy market has a data science problem.

:::
:::

::: notes
-   Forecasting is the most common data science objective
    -   according to 95% of data scientists in the energy market
-   The reasons for forecasting are quite common
    -   Trading
    -   Management
    -   Efficiency
    -   Storage
    -   Generation
-   All of these are reliant on, or can be enhanced by, good forecasting

## Data access is not the challenge {background-image="static/images/gradient_1-AGBjrE8Wxpc68qqN.svg"}

::: {.column style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"}
![](static/icons/noun-data-2500464-E03584.svg)
:::
:::

::: notes
-   Data access is not the challenge
    -   At least not any more
-   Data interconnectivity is relatively good in the UK
-   Over 50% of the buildings in the UK have smart meters
    -   According to BEIS
-   Octopus customers have first class integrations to their smart meter
-   Industry standard data aggregators and the D10 flow also help the data access landscape

:::

::: {.column style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"}
![](/static/icons/Data_Science_VD.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

::: notes
-   Very difficult to hire data scientists, no offence to the JavaScript/PHP/Ruby devs, but we are pretty out-numbered
    -   Hard to find with correct skills
        -   Tend to have a minimum of an Undergraduate Degree in Engineering or Mathematics
        -   Important to have Energy Market domain knowledge AND general software development skills in addition to Data Science Experience
-   This is what is making it hard to scale data science in the energy market
    -   And therefore also the products that rely on them
:::

# Existing non-solutions {background-image="static/images/gradient2-A1aNg8Lg5NTlR0e3.svg"}

::: notes
-   There are some common tools and approaches in this space
    -   But they all fail to solve the problem due to limitations of
        -   Scale
        -   Accuracy
        -   Accessibility
:::

## EPC/SAP {background-image="static/images/gradient_1-AGBjrE8Wxpc68qqN.svg"}

![](static/images/example-epc.png)

-   Scale limited by qualified surveyors
    -   And the cost and time of surveying
-   Only gives a usage range over year
    -   Not very useful for many needs

::: notes
-   A common tool in the UK is the EPC/SAP
    -   Government mandated Excel Calculator
-   Requires survey or desktop study by a qualified professional for each building
-   Only gives a usage range over year
-   Surveys only need to be re-done in specific purchases or changes of use
    -   Might be up to 10 years
:::

## Building simulation {background-image="static/images/gradient_1-AGBjrE8Wxpc68qqN.svg"}

::: {.columns style="display: flex !important; height: 90%;"}
::: {.column style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"}
![](static/icons/autodesk.svg){width="100%"} ![](static/icons/Energyplus.gif){width="70%"}
:::

::: {.column style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"}
-   requires a different model and survey per building
    -   can't scale at all
-   requires specialists to both survey and then simulate
    -   expensive to run per building
:::
:::

::: notes
-   A more heavy approach is to use building simulation software
    -   EnergyPlus and AutoDesk are the main suppliers
-   These are highly specialised and technical pieces of software
    -   with expensive licenses
-   Intended primarily for architecture/engineering work
-   Again this is not scaleable as each building needs it's own model
-   Difficult and potentially illegal to integrate into other software
    -   Depending on use and license
:::

## Custom Excel {background-image="static/images/gradient_1-AGBjrE8Wxpc68qqN.svg"}

::: {.columns style="display: flex !important; height: 90%;"}
::: {.column style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"}
-   Impossible to use the best techniques
-   Scale limited by available staff
-   Sheets are fragile
-   Import and export adds friction
:::

::: {.column style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"}
![](/static/icons/Microsoft_Excel_2013-2019_logo.png)
:::
:::

::: notes
-   Therefore many companies have built their own Excel sheets
    -   Still seems to be a popular choice
-   However this can be painful to build, worse to maintain, and limited in accuracy
    -   Small breakages can go un-noticed for a long time
        -   It's common to hand these tools between staff, so you may easily be the third person (or more) to handle it
            -   It's far too likely that the original authors work was 'modified' by the remaining authors, and so this sheet gets run for months or even years before someone realises the formula in sheet 1, cell X73 doesn't modify the value in sheet 2 the way it should, and this has been used to serve customers for an embarrassing amount of time
-   Excel is also limited in how advanced it can actually get
    -   Time to calculate a sheet can be nearly hours for 'advanced' models
        -   Still not actually that effective or accurate
-   Doesn't scale without hiring more staff to 'drive' more Excel workbooks per day

## In-House Software Development {background-image="static/images/gradient_1-AGBjrE8Wxpc68qqN.svg"}

![](/static/icons/Data_Science_VD.png){fig-align="center"}

```{=tex}
\begin{gather*}
cost = (salary * members) + OPEX + lost\: earning\\
cost = (50000 * [5-9]) + ? + ?
\end{gather*}
```
::: notes
-   So inevitably some companies have decided to build their own software
    -   This is a good idea, but it's not easy
-   You need to hire data scientists
    -   with the RIGHT domain knowledge and maths understanding
    -   probably multiple times
    -   and then you have to keep them
        -   bare in mind the supply \> demand problem
    -   and then you have to build the software and deploy it out to get any return on investment
    -   and then maintain and iterate on that system
-   The kicker of all this is, that everyone is doing it, going out and building data science teams in house, but they come out with fundamentally the same product
    -   Data Scientists in the sweet spot here are rare, but they go through multiple companies, rebuilding effectively the same systems, with the same techniques.
        -   I should know, I've done it

-   I have a masters in Environmental Building Science
    -   Which is the study of how buildings work
-   which lead me into the energy sector building data science software products
-   In the last few years I've been leading software product development teams in this market
-   And now I'm building ENGI.AI

## Ask {background-image="static/images/gradient_1-AGBjrE8Wxpc68qqN.svg"}

-   Energy sector contacts
    -   Users
    -   Partners
    -   People interested in being part of building ENGI.AI

::: notes
-   And so my ask for you folks is a mention in the right place
-   If over the last few minutes you've joined me in seeing the value of a product like this, keep ENGI.AI in mind when you're talking to people in your networks
-   It's been a fun trip so far, but to make it successful I know I can't do it alone. I need to grow the team as much as the product at this stage, and every contact helps
