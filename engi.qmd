# The energy market has a data science problem

## Everyone needs forecasts

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: r-fit-text
> "Forecasting using Time Series is the most common technique used in Data Science departments for companies in the Energy Market" - **Energy Systems Catapult Report**
:::
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](static/icons/3308891-200.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}
:::
:::

::: notes
-   Forecasting is the most common data science objective
    -   according to 95% of data scientists in the industry
-   Forecasting future energy demand, and the associated cost or supplying it.
:::

## Data access is not the challenge

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
> "The majority of buildings in the UK have a smart meter" - **BEIS/ONS?**
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](static/icons/data.png){.r-stretch}
:::
:::

::: notes
-   Over 50% of the buildings in the UK have smart meters
    -   According to BEIS
-   Octopus customers have first class integrations to their smart meter
-   Industry standard data aggregators and D10 flow
:::

## Rebuilding expensive wheels is the problem

> 40% of companies find it "Very Difficult" to hire Data Scientists with the right skills - **Energy Systems Catapult Report**

::: notes
-   Very difficult to hire data scientists, no offence to the JavaScript/PHP/Ruby devs, but there are a lot of you
    -   Hard to find with correct skills
        -   Tend to have a minimum of an Undergraduate Degree in Engineering or Mathematics
        -   Important to have Energy Market domain skills AND general software development skills in addition to Data Science Experience
    -   Expensive to hire
        -   Base salary of 50,000 per head
:::

# Existing non-solutions

## EPC/SAP

![](static/images/example-epc.png)

-   Very simple output
-   Very old information

::: notes
-   Government mandated Excel Calculator
-   Requires survey or desktop study by a professional
-   Only gives a usage range over year
-   Surveys only need to be re-done in specific purchases or changes of use
    -   Might be up to 10 years
:::

## Building simulation

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](static/icons/autodesk.svg){width="100%"} ![](static/icons/Energyplus.gif){width="70%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   requires specialists to both survey and then operate
    -   hard to build
-   requires a different model and survey per building
    -   can't scale at all
:::
:::

::: notes
-   EnergyPlus and AutoDesk
-   Whole building physics simulation
-   Highly specialised and technical
-   Not scaleable as each building needs it's own model
-   Difficult/illegal to integrate into other software
-   Intended primarily for architecture/engineering work
:::

## Custom Excel

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Sheets are fragile
-   Import and export adds friction
-   Scale limited by available staff
-   Impossible to use the best techniques
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](/static/icons/Microsoft_Excel_2013-2019_logo.png)
:::
:::

::: notes
-   Painful to build, worse to maintain
-   Small breakages can go un-noticed for a long time
-   Time to calculate a sheet can be nearly hours for 'advanced' models
    -   Still not actually that effective
-   Doesn't scale without more hiring to 'drive' the sheets
:::

## In-House Software Development

![](/static/icons/Data_Science_VD.png){fig-align="center"}

```{=tex}
\begin{gather*}
cost = (salary * members) + OPEX + lost\: earning\\
cost = (50000 * [5-9]) + ?
\end{gather*}
```

::: notes
-   Need to hire multiple data scientists
    -   with the RIGHT domain knowledge
-   and maybe normal software developers too
-   and then design, build, deploy and maintain
:::

# The solution

## What is needed?

::: notes
-   Not reliant on surveys
-   Up to date with the building
-   Informed by domain knowledge
-   Scales better than 
    -   a simulation per building
    -   an excel sheet per employee
    -   a data science team per company
:::

## ENGI.AI

::: notes
-   Energy forecasting as a service
    -   Plug and play into your existing software
-   Best practice techniques
-   AI doesn't need a description of the building
    -   So no surveys
-   Designed to be integrated
    -   Apps 
    -   IoT/BMS
    -   Network mechanisms
-   Developer friendly
:::
